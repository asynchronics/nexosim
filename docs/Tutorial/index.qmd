The [hello world tutorial](hello_world.qmd) is a good place to start as it
provides a simple demonstration of the structure and use of NeXosim simulations.
It also provides an example on how simulations can be controlled with the
python client through NeXosim's gRPC server.

The rest of the tutorial guides the reader through the process of
constructing and running a more complex simulation in NeXosim.
While doing so, it delves deeper into surrounding concepts including
authoring of models

The topics section includes a collection of pages going over particular uses
of the simulator.

## Prerequisites

These materials assume familiarity with Rust, including Rust's asynchronous
features.
