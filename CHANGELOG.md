- Add `EventQueue` sink (#[88])
- Implement `EventSinkReader` trait for `EventSlot`, including blocking read
  ([#88])

# 0.3.1 (2025-01-28)

- Add a blocking event queue ([#82])

[#82]: https://github.com/asynchronics/nexosim/pull/82


# 0.3.0 (2025-01-20)

The final 0.3.0 release features a very large number of improvements and API
changes, including all those in the beta release and a couple more.

This release is not compatible with the 0.2.* releases, but porting models and benches should be relatively straightforward.

### Added (mostly API-breaking changes)

- Add a gRPC server for local (Unix Domain Sockets) and remote (http/2)
  execution ([#12], [#24], [#25], [#26], [#29], [#43], [#78], [#79])
- Single-threaded executor supporting compilation to WebAssembly ([#24])
- Add support for the `tracing` crate ([#47])
- Make `Output`s and `Requestor`s `Clone`-able ([#30], [#48])
- Make the global `Scheduler` an owned `Clone`-able type that can be sent to
  other threads ([#30])
- Add an automatically managed action key for scheduled actions/events ([#27])
- Enable connection of different input/output pairs with `map_connect()` methods
  on `Output` and `Requestor` ([#32])
- Streamline the creation of data buses (SPI, CAN, MIL-STD-1553, SpaceWire etc.)
  with `filter_map_connect()` methods on `Output` and `Requestor` ([#32])
- Implement deadlock detection ([#51])
- Streamline the builder pattern for models with a `ProtoModel` trait ([#54])
- Implement execution timeout ([#57])
- Return an error when a real-time simulation clock looses synchronization
  ([#58])
- Catch model panics and report them as errors ([#60])
- Provide additional ordering guaranties when using the global scheduler ([#62])
- Remove `LineId` line disconnection API ([#63])
- Implement detection of lost and undelivered messages ([#68], [#70])
- Provide a `UniRequestor` type for unary requestors ([#69])
- Add support for intentionally halting an ongoing simulation and add a
  `Simulation::step_unbounded` method ([#74], [#77])

# 0.2.0 (2023-08-15)

### Added (API-breaking changes)

- Enable cancellation of events up to the very last moment, even if the event is

- Makes it possible to schedule periodic events from a `Simulation` or a model's
  `Scheduler` ([#6]).
- Mitigate the increase in API surface by merging each pair of
  `schedule_*event_in`/`schedule_*event_at` methods into one overloaded
  `schedule_*event` method that accept either a `Duration` or a `MonotonicTime`
  ([#7]).
